title: first day of jekyll
---

It's the first day to apply "Jekyll" on github.
Actually, I don't believe how I can make this. It just the word from github - honestly, I don't understand how to work inside github so far - but I searched for that keyword from google and read, read and read any kind of posting I can understand and keep digging the ground just before I made it.

I think, I have lots of "homework" for me this time. But it doesn't make me screw anyway. It's good chance to open the door inside code and development. The most important thing is interest, passion and curiosity whatever I do in any work.
