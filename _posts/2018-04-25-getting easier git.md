in the beginning, everything what I want to do is just difficult for me to understand what I have to do and how to work. but just doing it again and again makes me easy to understand even it's mistake or mess. I can get the feedback as result which means it could be the key to open the door that makes it done. just like my case right now. I know it's shity english and just a piece of X of my script. but I also know that small footprint could be the great beginning of adventure of life. -_-
