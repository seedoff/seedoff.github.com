I forgot this blog before I saw someone's posting in facebook. 

https://wayhome25.github.io/til/2017/08/14/TIL-for-6-months/

She said how to start to work again with "TIL" from github blog. I knew what "TIL" is but I don't have any idea what I write and wher I start. Her posting is just one kind of posting but I realized that it's not a big deal to start again when I read that. That's why I write this this morning.
